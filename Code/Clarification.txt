Enable Streaming Endpoint
With the Direct Line Speech channel connected to your bot, you now need to enable Bot Framework Protocol Streaming Extensions support for optimal, low-latency interaction.

"Enable Streaming Endpoint" is needed for Speech support. If you don't use Speech input, you don't need to enable this option.

Is it necessary?
Yes, if you're using the Direct Line Speech channel, then it is a must before you enable Web socket support.
No, if you're not using the Direct Line Speech channel, leave it unchecked as by default.
